# Long Term Support

1. Every LTS release is actively maintained and any critical bugs fixed.  The LTS period is yet to be determined, but will be at least 12 months from the initial LTS release. 
2. There are no restrictions on adding new features or enhancements to LTS releases.
3. Even after a release is no longer in LTS, the seneca maintainers will do their due diligence and fix any critical security vulnerabilities if they arrise.
