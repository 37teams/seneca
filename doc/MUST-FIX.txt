# 0.6.0:
  - entity.data$ default canon format is string
  - nicer error msg for plugin not found
  - error msg if store has not yet connected to db
  - prevent use of _ in zone, base, name, also ensure matches [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*, option to turn off for backwards compat
  - delegate needs to have var self = this in all methods
