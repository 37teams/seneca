- callbacks have err object as first argument
  - err object always has structure: {err:'string_code',desc:{object}}
    - where desc is err dependent, but is can always by JSON.stringified to print
      - so no resource-bound values in desc! just static values

- logging entries should emit before the described action
  - means that the action is described in log before error message
